This project is an example of how different electronic devices and sensors installed within a household can function together in synchronization in order to create a comfortable home and effective lifestyle. They function under the IOT system where they communicate either through serial communication or the internet using Google Assistant. They were applied on a miniature house of length 120 cm, width of 60 cm and height of 65 cm where different sensors were installed in order to perform a wide range of tasks required in any modern household. These sensors and actuators installed within this smart house are all used under the consideration of making the house sustainable and eco-friendly.
Moreover, itâ€™s equipped with electronic machines that generate sustainable energy like solar panels and different sensors are used inside the house in order to reduce the consumption of electricity. As for water, there are different sensors used to manage water usage and control it without human interference. These electronic parts all work together in an effort to make the house more sustainable and eliminate human error by only depending on each other to perform the tasks required.
The house has the ability to communicate with its owner through a mobile application and a central Infrared remote inside the premises.
